    "As an abstract model, WordNet provides a mapping of the vocabulary of a language to a set of concepts with semantic relations between these concepts. The concepts and relations form a huge semantic graph or space, in which one concept is related to another. In the next picture, you only see a fragment of the WordNet graph for all concepts related to communication, which is the concept in the center. This graph only shows the `hyponymy` relations, which are most dominant in WordNet. You can travel from the edge of the graph to the center and take another branch back the the edge. In this way, you could reach any communication related concept. \n",

    "![wordnet](./images/wn-communication.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is so dense that you cannot read the words that map to each concept. You can imagine how the graph would look like if you project the complete WordNet space as a universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping of the words of a language to the concepts is complex. Synonymous words form a so-called `synset`, e.g. `{board, surf board}`, which represents a single concept. However, a word from a synset such as `board` can also have other meanings (`polysemy`), and therefore occur in other synsets as well. There is therefore a many-to-many relation between words and concepts through the synset mappings. Finally, it is important to realize that nouns, verbs and adjectives form different subgraphs in WordNet and exhibit different relations.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will explain how to access the graph structure and explore it as well as how to measure how close or distant concepts and words are according to the graph. We first need to import the *wordnet* module from NLTK:"
