    "A final note on working with the terminal/command line. In your professional work, you are most likley going to use the terminal. You may have to connect your laptop to a server that runs Linux or Unix or Windows and run scripts with series of commands without a graphical interface. Typically, you run jobs with a lot of text data (hunderds of thousands, millions of documents) on these servers and not on your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is good to familiarize yourself in due time with different operating systems: Linux, Unix (Mac), Windows and using a command line interface. If it is too overwhelming now, don't worry. You will get it eventually during the master."

    "The first choice you have to make is what editor you want to use for running and creating notebooks. The editor that we recommend is [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to launch [JupyterLab] is from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Step 1: open the command line or a terminal \n",
    "<li>  Step 2: type \"jupyter lab\" and press enter.\n",
    "<li>  Step 3: navigate to the folder where you stored the notebooks for Lab 1\n",

    "    * Click the 'play' button next to the 'stop' and 'refresh' button in the toolbar.\n",
    "    * Alt + Enter runs the current cell and creates a new cell. \n",
    "    * Ctrl + Enter runs the current cell without creating a new cell.\n",
    "    * Shift + Enter runs the current cell and moves to the next one.\n",
    "    * Use the menu and select *Kernel* -> *Restart Kernal and Run All Cells*\n",
    "* The instructions are written in Markdown. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a nice Markdown cheatsheet if you want to write some more.\n",
