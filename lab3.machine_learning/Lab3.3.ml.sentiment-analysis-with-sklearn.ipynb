Since we are dealing with texts, we also need some specific packages from *sklearn* to operate on texts to get words as features. Finally, we use the *nltk* package to get a list of *stop words*. *Stop words* occur frequently in any text and are not discriminative across texts. We assume you have all these packages already installed using **pip** or **conda** in the previous notebooks so you can import them here."

We define an instance of CountVectorizer for the data set and set a number of parameters that design the model:\n",

In general, words that only occur once poorly generalise to other data and words that always occur in all texts poorly discriminate between different categories. Furthermore, stop word lists are often derived from large text collections taking the most frequent words, which may boil down to set a `max_df` threshold. However, this is not always the case and you could add specific words yourself to remove noisy or disturbing words from the model.\n",

A NaiveBayes (NB) classifier is a so-called generative classifier that learns the probablity of a word given a category. By assessing the probability of words for a text, it can aggregate how likely a text is for a category. You will learn more about this type of classifier in the machine learning course. For now it is enough to know that NB works reasonably for smaller data sets and with little training. You can check out this tutorial for more information: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/naivebayes.pdf.\n",
