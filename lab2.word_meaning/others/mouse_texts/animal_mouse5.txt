From the floppy ears of dogs to the curly tails of pigs, domesticated
animals sport a different look from their wild cousins—a look that
scientists chalked up to human intervention. Now, a new study of wild
mice shows that they, too, can develop signs of domestication—white fur
patches and short snouts—with hardly any human influence. The work
suggests that the mice are able to tame themselves, and that other
animals like dogs may have done the same before they were fully
domesticated by humans.
