Have you considered reaching out to her again or maybe talking to a mutual friend to get in touch with her? Sometimes people don't realize how their actions affect others, and a calm conversation might help clear things up.\n",

In the meantime, are you going to try to get in touch with your friend or just focus on getting to that meeting on time?\n",

What do you think might be wrong or why do you think they might fire you? Sometimes talking through our fears and worries can help us feel better prepared and more in control.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
