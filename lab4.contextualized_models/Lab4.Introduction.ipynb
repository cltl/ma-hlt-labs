    "In Lab4 you will learn to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Large Language Models are built by unsupervised learning on large amounts of texts, so-called pretraining. During pretraining the task is to learn a presentation that predicts context words with the help of yet other context words. \n",

    "We discuss two types of LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* bidirectional encoders, e.g. BERT: words to the left and right are masked and also left and right context words can help\n",
    "* genererative decoders, e.g. GPT and LLama: only words to the left can be used to predict the next word in a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "We explain the basics and show how these models are used to perform NLP tasks."
