Some tablet and laptop manufacturers may say that the best mouse is a
finger tap, but we just don’t agree. There’s nothing quite like using a
mouse to navigate your PC. No matter whether you’re a PC or Mac user, a
trackpad or touchscreen just isn’t the same. This is because the best
mice, unlike trackpads, aren’t limited to the space between your
keyboard and the edge of your laptop – they can be as precise or as
unruly as you prefer.
