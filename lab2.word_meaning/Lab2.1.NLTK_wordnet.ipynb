    "As an abstract model, WordNet provides a mapping of the vocabulary of a language to a set of concepts with semantic relations. The concepts and relations form a huge semantic graph or space, in which one concept is related to another. In the next picture, you only see a fragment of the WordNet graph for all concepts related to communication, which is the concept in the center. This graph only shows the `hyponymy` relations, which are most dominant in WordNet. You can travel from the edge of the graph to the center and take another branch back the the edge. In this way, you could reach any communication related concept. \n",

    "The mapping of the words of a language to the concepts is complex. Synonymous words map to the same concepts, which are called `synsets`, and the same word can have different meanings (`polysemy`) and therefore map to different concepts/synsets as well. Furthermore, the nouns, verbs and adjectives form different subgraphs and exhibit different relations.\n",
