    "In this notebook, we introduce you to word embeddings. Word embeddings are vector representations for words learned by a neural network to predict words that occur in their context. The weights applied to the hidden layer to make the correct predictions form the vector that acts as a representation for the meaning of the word. Usually, vector sizes are limited to 300 to 500 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For learning these representations a large corpus of text is needed with sufficient occurrences of words in different contexts. As negative examples of words that do not occur in the context, random words are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages is that comparing vectors of words always gives a result for these certain dimensions: i.e. the vectors are dense vectors. Vectors match most strongly when words occur in similar contexts. Obviously, words that do not have a representation, such as domain specific terminology, cannot be matched either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many packages and data sets with embeddings, we focus on publicly available and trainable embeddings, especially for multiple languages. Concretely, we will use embeddings from:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Wikipedia2Vec](https://wikipedia2vec.github.io/wikipedia2vec/pretrained/)\n",
    "* [Fasttext](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/docs/crawl-vectors.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia2Vec created word embeddings for 9 languages built from the Wikipedia pages in these languages. Fasttext, created by Facebook, created embeddings for 157 languages from web data collected by the [Common Crawl project](https://commoncrawl.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the embeddings are created through different Pythn packages, they are also available in a common Word2Vec text format. This makes it possible to load the embeddings regardless of how they have been created by the same package. We will use the *GenSim* package to load the data."
