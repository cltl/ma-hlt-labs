Well, it's sad to say, but I'm confident I'll never be drafted onto a
professional gaming league any time soon (due to age discrimination, not
my ability, obviously). But that doesn't mean pro hardware doesn't
appeal to me or any other PC gamer who is looking for a little edge in
competitive games. The new Logitech G Pro mouse retains most of the
design cues of the original, including a pleasingly light 83g weight
(sans the cable), which is really light for a mouse. To put it into
context, the SteelSeries Rival 600 weighs 96g, and a Razer Death Adder
is a chunky 130g. A vibrant RGB light bar swoops around the bottom curve
of the mouse, and the the Logitech G logo still lights up, as well.
