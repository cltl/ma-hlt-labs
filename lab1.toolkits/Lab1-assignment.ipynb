    "**Points**: each exercise is prefixed with the number of points you can obtain for the exercise. However, these points are just an indication of what parts we value more. The assignment itself is assessed as PASS/NO-PASS. In general, we value a critical analysis of the OUTPUT of running code more than just showing that you can create or run the code. So if you succesfully carried out the instructed commands in a notebook you are not done yet. We want you to analyse, understand what the code is doing with language and text. Be critical, think about how to explain what you observe and write this down in the notebook after running the code. It will be stated clearly in the assignment when we expect this from you.\n",
