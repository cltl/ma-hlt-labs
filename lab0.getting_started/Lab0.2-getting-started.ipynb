Jupyter notebooks can be opened in a web browser and let you run python commands, visualise the output and add documentation using Markdown language. They are very easy to use and adapt so that you can experiment with the material step-by-step. By making your own notes in addition you can create your own learning experience. We will next explain how to install and use it."

For example, many important Python packages rely on ```numpy```, which is an efficient package to handle so-called arrays with numbers. In machine learning and Large Language Models these **arrays** are used to make calculations. One of the problems you may come across is that different packages rely on different versions of **numpy** which are incompatible. So **numpy** is updated and one developer updates his/her package using the new version of **numpy** while another developer does not. The result is that you cannot use the combination of packages because they require different versions of **numpy**."
