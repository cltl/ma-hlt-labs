A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a
cursor in a GUI and can move and select text, icons, files, and folders.
For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface such as a
mouse pad or a desk and is placed in front of your computer. The picture
to the right is an example of a desktop computer mouse with two buttons
and a wheel.
