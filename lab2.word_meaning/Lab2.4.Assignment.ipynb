So if you succesfully carried out the instructed commands in a notebook you are not done yet. We want you to analyse, understand what the code is doing with language and text. Be critical, think about how to explain what you observe and write this down in the notebook after running the code. We will clarify in the assignment when we expect this from you.\n",
