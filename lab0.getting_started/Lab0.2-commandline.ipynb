    "A final note on working with the terminal/command line. In your professional work, you are most likley going to use the terminal. You may have to connect your laptop to a server that runs Linux or Unix or Windows and run scripts with series of commands without a graphical interface. Typically, you run jobs with a lot of text data (hunderds of thousands, millions of documents) on these servers and not on your laptop.\n",
