    "The overall process of machine learning is shown in the next image that is taken from Chapter 6 of the NLTK book. In general, machine learning consists of a training phase in which an algorithm associates data features with certain labels (e.g. sentiment, part-of-speech). The training results in a classifier model that can be applied to unseen data. The classifier compares the features of the unseen data with the previously seen data and makes a prediction of the label on the basis of some similarity calculation.\n",

    "![title](images/ml-schema.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucial in this process is 1) the features that represent the data and 2) the algorithm that is used. In this course, we are not going to discuss the various machine learning algorithms in depth but we focus on the text features and how they are represented as so-called feature vectors. In the case of a text, we need to define what the features are that characterize the text. These features are transformed into a feature vector representation that the algorithm and model can handle. In order to compare unseen text with the training texts, it is crucial that features are extracted and represented in the same way across training and applying (among which testing)."
