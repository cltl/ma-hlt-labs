Mice and rats are really gentle, interesting animals. But sadly,
millions of them are killed in painful experiments every year in the
U.S. In these tests, rats and mice are poisoned, burned, shocked, and
terrified on purpose. Many laboratories that use these animals arenâ€™t
even required to give them medicine for pain or any kind of vet care,
and lots of them end up dying after suffering for a very long time.
