    "Most NLP tasks, e.g., part of speech tagging, sentiment analysis, named-entity recognition, etc., are defined as a classification task. The goal is to classify a textual unit, e.g., word, lemma, sentence, document, etc., into some category. It is essential that we evaluate NLP systems thoroughly, which gives us insight into their strengths and weaknesses. In this notebook, we show how to compute the most crucial evaluation metrics, which are Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub> or F-measure.\n",

In the case of sentiment analysis, the task is sometimes defined as classifying a textual unit such as *What a great hotel!* into one of three categories: *negative* | *neutral* | *positive*.

Then, we let an NLP system perform Sentiment Analysis on the same data, which we will call **system_output**. For evaluation, we compare the **system_output** to the **gold**.

    "Carefully inspect all the metrics and think about what this tells us about the strengts and weaknesses of the system. \n",
    "Recall and precision often form a balance, when one goes up the other goes down. A confusion matrix can help how classes relate to each other but to really understand what is going on, it is good practice to inspect individual cases where the system failed and try to analyse why. Such insights help designing better systems or consider other features."
