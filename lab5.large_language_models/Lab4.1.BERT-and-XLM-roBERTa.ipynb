    "There is whole family of transformer models developed by different research groups and published on the Huggingface platform. We will look at two popular LLMs BERT and its sequel RoBERTa, specifically its crosslingual variant XML-RoBERTa.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, without human labelling. BERT was pretrained with two objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Masked language modeling (MLM): given a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input. It next runs the entire masked sentence through the model to predict the masked words from the unmasked words. The weights of the unmasked words are adapted to make the right predictions, just as with word embeddings, but do this together usiing **Attention**. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which only mask the next tokens. BERT learns a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n",
    "* Next sentence prediction (NSP): the model concatenates two masked sentences as input during pretraining. Sometimes they correspond to sentences that were following each other in the original text (positive example), sometimes it is a random sentence (negative example). The model then has to predict if the two sentences were following each other or not. A special [CLS] token preceding the sentence representation is adapted to make the right prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core trick of the model is **Attention**, hence the seminal paper \"Attention is all you need\" (Vaswani et al 2017). Attention refers to the principle that the embedding representation of a word in a sequence that needs to predict the masked tokens gets help from other tokens. Likewise, the model learns which words in the context pay most attention to the role of predicting masked words. In the next two examples, the representation of **star** will be different due to the attention of the other context words in order to predict **movie** and **planet** respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the [masked] star went in rehab --> masked=movie\n",
    "* the orbit of the [masked] around the star is not stable --> masked=planet\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "This is applied to all words in a sequence and over many (11 to more than 20) layers with different attention heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually running many times over large amounts of data, the models learn an inner representation of the English language (a language model) that can then be used to represent sentences in texts as contextual vectors. If you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard classifier using the representations produced by the BERT model as inputs. This is called fine-tuning: \n",
    "\n",
    "![finetune](fine-tuning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These contextual representations turn out to be very effective in downstream tasks after fine-tuning. In many papers, researchers demonstrated that contextual representations capture implicit properties that are better for training a classifier than feature-engineered representations. Whereas terrabytes of text data has been used for pretraining the LLM, relatively little data is needed to fine-tune the model for a specific classification task. A small training set (Megabytes) is represented through the LLM and a classification head is trained to associate labels, such as sentiment, topic, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "RoBERTa is a more efficient sequel to BERT in which the next sentence prediction was dropped, more data, more layers and wider contexts were used (Liu et al 2019). It often gives better performance than BERT in downstream tasks but it is bigger and more heavy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "XLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual version of RoBERTa. It is pre-trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl data containing 100 languages (Lample and Conneau 2019). XLM-RoBERTa can represent text in any of these languages and when finetuned in one language (or more) the classification head can be applied to all these languages. This makes it possible to profit from for example English training data that is available for to be used for all languages in the model even if there is no labeled data in that specific language.\n",
